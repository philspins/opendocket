# Security Considerations

## Overview

The GOAT (Go, Templ, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS) stack, sometimes referred to as GOTH or GoTTH when using HTMX, offers a secure-by-default, server-side rendered (SSR) architecture, but it requires specific attention to modern web vulnerabilities, particularly around JavaScript execution and content policies. 

## Key Security Considerations

- Content Security Policy (CSP): While the stack reduces reliance on complex client-side frameworks, implementing a strict CSP is difficult when using Alpine.js or HTMX. Alpine.js requires unsafe-eval for many features, which weakens protection against cross-site scripting (XSS).
- XSS in Templating: templ provides compile-time checking and automatic context-aware escaping for HTML elements, which significantly reduces the risk of XSS compared to raw string concatenation.
- HTMX Security: Since HTMX updates HTML partials directly from the server, ensure that server-side handlers properly escape any user-supplied content included in returned HTML fragments.
- Alpine.js Interactivity: When using Alpine for client-side state, be cautious of potential client-side XSS if user input is directly rendered into Alpine x-data attributes.
- Authentication & Session Management: Use secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookies for JWT or session management in Go, rather than storing sensitive data in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS.
- Input Validation: Perform rigorous input validation on the Go backend. Do not rely solely on front-end validation (e.g., HTML attributes or Alpine validation).
- Dependency Management: While Go has a strong standard library, the stack often uses Node.js for Tailwind and build tools. Keep all Node modules (bun install) and Go modules (go mod tidy) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices

- Use Templ Components: Leverage templ’s type-safe components to ensure HTML structure is sanitized at compile time.
- Secure Headers: Implement essential security headers like X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: DENY, and Content-Security-Policy.
- Asset Security: If using CDNs for Tailwind or Alpine, use SRI (Subresource Integrity) hashes.

## Summary

The GOAT stack's primary strength is reducing surface area by handling logic on the server, but it is not inherently immune to XSS, particularly when using Alpine.js.
